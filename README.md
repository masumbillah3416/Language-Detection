## Project Idea
### Motivation 
<!-- Describe here why this project is being done. -->
Language identification is the task of recognizing a language by looking at text or listening to speech. It is one of the most challenging, yet incredibly relevant tasks in computational linguistics. Well-performing systems are necessary for both conducting linguistic research and creating various applications that work with linguistic data. In this work we only focus on recognizing textual instances. The task of language identification is aimed at recognizing all possible natural languages. The language communities are often under-resourced, and without language recognition systems they are slowed down in their progress in developing various instruments for researching the respective languages. But all the available language recognition system incurr a fee for using their services which hampers a lot of aspiring people in their work. We intend to make it open source for anyone to use and add more languages. We collect online resources for as many languages as possible.
### Scope
<!-- Describe the domain space of the project. -->
This project will include collecting datasets, creating models for training, training the model, use the model in the application, publish the application for the public. The source code with be made open source on github for further development.
### Platform
<!-- What is the environment requirement of the project? What is the OS? Is it for mobile, web, or general API? -->
Type: Web based Application

Environment: Visual Studio Code, Github, Pycharm

Languge: Python, Django, Javascript
### Project Brief
<!-- Describe the project in brief. -->
This will be an web based text language detection system that will detect the language of the text.

            Further development is required.  The number of datasets collected is not sufficient to train the model. Hence, more datasets are required. Libraries like  Scikit-Learn, and Pandas are required to train the model. The model will be trained on the collected datasets.
